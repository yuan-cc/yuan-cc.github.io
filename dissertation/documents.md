**Abstract**<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical coincident detection of gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from the binary neutron star merger event GW 170817 heralds a new era in multi-messenger astronomy. At the same time, since the first discovery of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos in 2012 by IceCube, neutrino astrophysics has made significant progress and has started playing an increasingly important role in multi-messenger analyses. We are currently in the stage where we can probe the nature of the extreme astrophysical phenomena with the synergies between EM photons, neutrinos, GWs, and cosmic rays. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dissertation, I start with an overview of the development of multi-messenger astrophysics and its application to astrophysical mergers. I will present our work on the cumulative diffuse neutrino background from galaxy/cluster mergers and show that our scenario can explain the diffuse neutrino flux without violating the extragalactic gamma-ray background constraints (chapter 2). We further demonstrate that the synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions produced by secondary electrons/positrons are consistent with the radio and X-ray observations of merging galaxies such as NGC 660 and NGC 3256 (chapter 3). In chapters 4 & 5, we focus on the jet-induced neutrino and EM counterparts from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers subsequent to GW radiation and discuss the detection perspectives for the ongoing and next-generation neutrino, optical, and GW missions. The short gamma-ray bursts, which are generally thought to arise from compact binary object (CBO) mergers, could be promising candidates for multi-messenger studies. We then consider a special scenario where short GRBs are embedded in disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and investigate their GeV signatures in chapter 6.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a separate effort, we study the stacking and multiplet constraints on the blazar contribution to the cumulative diffuse neutrino flux, assuming a generic relationship between neutrino and gamma-ray luminosities (chapter 7). We show that these two limits are complementary, and our results support the argument that blazars are disfavored as the dominant sources of the 100-TeV neutrino background. This work provides rather general and stringent constraints for future studies of blazar neutrinos.
