"知识之必要，探索之必要，片刻宁静之必要，身心安顿之必要，手感之必要，凝视之必要，气味之必要，书写之必要"

“The necessity of knowledge, the necessity of exploration, the necessity of moments of tranquility, the necessity of settling the body and mind, the necessity of tactile sensation, the necessity of gazing, the necessity of scent, the necessity of writing.”
