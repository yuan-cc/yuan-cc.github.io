## Welcome!

I a fifth year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Penn State. I'm working with Prof. [Péter Mészáros](http://personal.psu.edu/nnp/) and Prof. [Kohta Murase](https://science.psu.edu/physics/people/kohta-murase) with the emphasis in high-energy astrophysics and astroparticle physics. Prior to begining my Ph.D. career in 2016, I obtained my B.Sc. degree of Astronomy from Nanjing University in China. 

I am working on the theoretical aspects of multi-messenger astrophysics, including the origins and implications of high-energy photons, cosmic rays and neutrinos from individual cosmic sources and source populations. In particular, I model the **acceleration, transport and radiation processes** of high-energy particles originated from **compact binary pairs (super massive/stellar mass black holes), supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei and galaxy/cluster mergers**. I am interested in how the multi-messenger analyses enlighten our understanding on the physical nature of high-energy astrophysical phenomena.
