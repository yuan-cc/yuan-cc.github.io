## Welcome!

I am starting my fifth year (as of Aug 2020) towards a Ph.D. of Physics at Penn State. With the emphasis in high-energy astrophysics, I'm working with Prof. Péter Mészáros and Prof. Kohta Murase. Prior to begining my Ph.D. career in 2016, I obtained my B.Sc. degree of Astronomy from Nanjing University in China. 

I am working on the theoretical aspects of multi-messenger astrophysics, including the origins and implications of high-energy photons, cosmic rays and neutrinos from individual cosmic sources and source populations. In particular, I model the **acceleration, transport and radiation processes** of high-energy particles originated from **compact binary pairs (super massive/stellar mass black holes), supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei and galaxy/cluster mergers**. I am interested in how the multi-messenger analyses enlighten our understanding on the physical nature of high-energy astrophysical phenomena.
