**Overview**

The motivation of this project is that the merger of dark matter halos and the gaseous structures embedded in them, such as protogalaxies, galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies, results in strong shocks that are capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to ~ 10 PeV. These shocks will produce high-energy neutrinos and gamma-rays through inelastic *pp* collisions. In the first part this work, we study the contributions of these halo mergers to the diffuse neutrino flux and to the nonblazar portion of the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We formulate the redshift dependence of the shock velocity, galactic radius,
halo gas content, and galactic/intergalactic magnetic fields over the dark matter halo distribution up to a redshift
*z = 10*. The schematic figure shows the propagation and interactions of cosmogenic CRs.

We find that high-redshift mergers contribute a significant amount of the CR luminosity density, and the
resulting neutrino spectra could explain a large part of the observed diffuse neutrino flux above 0.1 PeV up to
several PeV. We also show that our model can somewhat alleviate tensions with the extragalactic gamma-ray
background. The main reason is that a larger fraction of the CR luminosity density comes from high redshifts. In this case the accompanying γ-rays are more strongly suppressed through γγ annihilations with the cosmic microwave background and the extragalactic background light.
