### Complementarity of stacking and multiplet constraints on blazar neutrinos

The [full paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab65ea)

**Overview**

We investigate the blazar contribution to the cumulative neutrino intensity assuming a generic
relationship between neutrino and gamma-ray luminosities, Lν ∝ (L_ph)^*&gamma;*. Using the gamma-ray
luminosity functions for blazars including flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lac objects,
as well as the F ermi-LAT detection efficiency, we estimate contributions from blazars resolved by
F ermi-LAT as well as the unresolved counterpart. The figure below shows the fraction of *Fermi*-LAT-resolved blazars in the
cumulative neutrino flux as a function of the index *&gamma;*.
