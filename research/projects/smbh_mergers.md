**Overview**

Supermassive black hole (SMBH) coalescences are ubiquitous in the history of the Universe and
often exhibit strong accretion activities and powerful jets. These SMBH mergers are also promising candidates for future gravitational wave detectors such as Laser Space Inteferometric Antenna (LISA). In this work, we consider neutrino counterpart emission originating from the jet-induced
shocks. The physical picture is that relativistic jets launched after the merger will push forward
inside the premerger disk wind material, and then they subsequently get collimated, leading to the
formation of internal shocks, collimation shocks, forward shocks and reverse shocks. Cosmic rays can
be accelerated in these sites and neutrinos are expected via the photomeson production process. We
formulate the jet structures and relevant interactions therein, and then evaluate neutrino emission
from each shock site. The schematic picture below shows the structure of the jet-cocoon system.
