### Monte Carlo simulation of electron-photon interactions with pair formation

The [write-up](e_gamma_write_up.pdf)

**Overview**

(I completed this project during my visit to Penn State in Summer 2015.)

In this project, I wrote an adaptive Monte Carlo code for solving the time-dependent kinetic equation for relativistic electron in an isotropic
photon field. The synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering, gamma-gamma pair production and pair annihilation are included.
