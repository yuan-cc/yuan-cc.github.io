**Overview**

(This was my first research project. When I was a second-year undergraduate student in NJU, I received this project from Prof. Fayin Wang and then I started to study the fundamental theories of cosmology as well as the relevant programming skills. I was so happy and excited to witness the publication of this paper after one year's hard work.)
