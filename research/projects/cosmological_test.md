**Overview**

(This was my first research project. When I was a second-year undergraduate student in NJU, I received this project from Prof. Fayin Wang and then I started to study the fundamental theories of cosmology as well as the relevant programming skills. I was so happy and excited to witness the publication of this paper after one year's hard work.)

One of the most intriguing predictions from Einstein's general relativity is that the light can be bent around a massive object. In the cosmological distances, strong gravitational lensing occurs when the bending effect is strong enough to produce mutiple images of the source. The temporal and geometric properties (e.g. the time delay and the velocity disperson of the lens galaxy) of the image encodes the information of the angular diameter distances between observer, lens and source. In this case, we can use such lensing systems a a probe of the universe and constrain the gravitational parameters that determines the cosmological distance.

In this work, instead of treating the time delay and velocity disperson as independent probes, we find that the combined quantity 
(time delay)/(velocity disperson)^2 is more sensitive for different cosmological models, as illustrated in the figure below.
